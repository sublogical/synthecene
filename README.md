# Components
## Data Engine

* curate intensely valuable datasets for AI
* make it easy for enterprises to do the same
* novel human processes with radical productivity
* manage production ml processes fire and forget

* Datastore
* Tools
  * authoring - visual studio for data
  * visualizaiton
  * analytic

### Orchestration
* long-runing (days+) tasks
* restartable/retryable
* high-cardinality tasks (e.g. spawned by agentic interactions)
* human tasks - ask 

### Processing
* run inference
  * autorater / reward model
  * LLM / agent "agile classifier

### Storage
* batch update to trillions of examples
* point update to thousands to millions of examples


## Agent Engine

### HITL

* make it easy to build AI agents that include HITL
* ask the LLM "how should we go about accomplishing this task"
* LLM can include "ask <<type of human>> to perform <<specification of task>>"
* agent can ask a human to confirm an action prior to execution

### Cadre

* support collections of specialized agents that work against each other to improve
  * critic that is specialized in finding flaws in code
  * critic that is specialized in readability of code
  * critic that looks for vulnerabilities in code
  * critic that applies constitutional constraints to a response and/or plan
  * critic 
 

## Data Bench

### Data Critic
* CR-like tool for reviewing / approving changes to datasets

### Data Diff
* Data Diff - tool for comparing datasets, summarizing differences

### Data Viz
* Embedding Visualization
* Multimodal Visualization

### Datasheet
* Google-sheets interface for data curation


# Prototypes
## Dust off

### Tech to Try out
* Android - Kotlin + Android Developer Kit
* Ruby on Rails
* Agent on o1 or some other API-based LLM
* Angular Web App
* Rust Service
* Rust WASM
* Embedded Vision App


### Ideas to Build
* Agent data curation / evaluation interface
* Agent framework ala langchain supporting multimodal and streaming bidirectional (ala Astra)
* Multiagent orchestration
  * safety
  * critique
  * self-train
* Benchmark data collection
  * https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucinlp/drop
* Android Wellness Logger App








# what to do next

* stay at Google
  * can probably be making 2.5M/year by this time next year
  * can get to retirement in the next year or two pretty reliably
  * can
* do a startup
  * likely to be a really incredible experience
  * probably not compatible with sustain
